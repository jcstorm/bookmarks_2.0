== README

This is an early project from a Ruby on Rails class held by Starter League at 1871 in the Merchandise Mart, Chicago. It is meant to demonstrate CREATE, READ, EDIT, and DESTROY functionality on a MySQL database.

To run this example:

1. Open a Rails server
2. Route to /users
3. The program allows simple CREATE, READ, EDIT, and DESTROY of a username and email address.
